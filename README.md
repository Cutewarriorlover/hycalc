# HyCalc

HyCalc is a project intended to let players of Hypixel Skyblock be able to rest assured knowing that they have a `1` in `48.5906984058493945859` chance of getting that rare item they wanted. In other words, HyCalc is a Hypixel Skyblock calculator.

## Why?

From my experience of playing Hypixel Skyblock, it seemed that there was a lot of math involved. You want to know how much damage you can take before dying? Sure, just whip out that simple equation:

As you can see, this is simple. However, do I want to do that every time I have enough coins to buy a new armor set? **No**.
